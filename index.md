## International Lead Time

Reducing Lead Time is a tradeoff between costs. There is a cost to holding inventory longer during transit times and there is a cost to using a faster mode of transportation. A portion of Graphic Packagingâ€™s business is produced in the United States and then shipped internationally to be finished. To understand inventory levels and production rate, lead time must be fully understood. Once the lead time data is collected additional projects can be implemented to reduce lead time and costs from the supply chain. The data used in this report is from Graphic Packaging but it has been manipulated to protect any proprietary information.
